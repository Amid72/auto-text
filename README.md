# Typing Text Animation Project

This is a simple and elegant JavaScript project that creates a typing animation effect for specified words, complete with a blinking cursor. It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Animated typing and erasing of text
- Customizable word list
- Smooth visual effects with CSS
- Minimal dependencies

## Demo

Words like **"Awesome"** and **"Fun"** are animated one letter at a time, giving a live-typing impression with a colored blinking cursor.

## File Structure

- `untitle.js` – Core logic for typing/erasing effect
- `Untitled-1.css` – Styling for the page and animation elements

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-text-animation.git
````

2. Open the `index.html` (create one if missing) in your browser.
3. Customize the `words` array in `untitle.js` to add your own text.

## Example HTML (if missing)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Typing Animation</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Untitled-1.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Typing Animation</h1>
    <p><span class="typed-text"></span><span class="cursor">|</span></p>
    <script src="untitle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Customization

* Change text color via `.typed-text` in CSS.
* Modify typing speed in `untitle.js` using `typingDelay` and `erasingDelay`.
